# ACCORD Conflict Detection

ACCORD Conflict Detection is a Flask-based web application designed to manage and detect conflicts in Google Drive activity logs. The application extracts activity logs, defines fine-grained action constraints on shared resources, and uses a conflict detection algorithm to identify and resolve conflicts.

## Installation

1. **Install Google Client Library for Access Activity Logs via Reports API:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
   ```
2. **Install Flask and related libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   pip install Flask-WTF Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Migrate
   ```
3. **Install other necessary libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install pyyaml flask-mysqldb
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Database Setup (MySQL Workbench locally):** Database dump can be provided on request.
2. **API access tokens for reports API in token.json and tokens directory contains drive api tokens**: json files and access tokens can be provided to authorized personnel on request.

## Application routes (app.py)

1. **/ (index):** Renders the main page (index.html) and initializes the Google Drive Reports API service for the admin user
2. **/refresh_logs (POST):** Updates the local database with the latest Google Drive activity logs retrieved using the Reports API.
3. **/detect_conflicts_demo (POST):** Handles the demonstration of conflict detection. Retrieves logs and action constraints from the database, runs the detection algorithm (detectmain), and returns detected conflicts with detection time metrics.
4. **/addActionConstraints (POST):** Receives JSON data containing user-defined action constraints, processes them, and adds them to the database (log_details) for future conflict detection.
5. **/fetch_actionConstraints (POST):** Retrieves action constraints from the database based on a specified date, processes them into a structured format, and returns them as JSON for display.
6. **/fetch_drive_log (GET):** Retrieves Google Drive activity logs from the Reports API based on a specified start time (startTime) and updates the local log database (log_details).
7. **/get_action_constraints (POST):** Retrieves specific action constraints from the database (log_details) based on document ID, action type, and constraint target, and returns them as JSON.

## index.html

1. **Fetch Logs Tab:** Allows users to select a date and fetch activity logs from a specified date. It includes a table to display fetched logs, a loader for indicating data fetching, and a button to detect conflicts based on the fetched logs.

2. **Action Constrains Tab:** Enables users to view and manage action constraints associated with logged activities. It includes a form to select a date, a button to display action constraints for that date, and a table to show detailed constraints including timestamps, target resources, and owners.

## Conflict Detection Algorithm: Detection Time Calculation

1. Extract activity logs from database.
2. Extract all action constraints from database.
3. T0 -> Start Time
4. Call Detection Engine to compare activity logs against action constraints to detect conflicts. (Activity Handler and Action Constraint Handler)
5. Identify conflicts and store them.
6. T1 -> Stop Timer
7. T1-T0 = Detection Time

## Running the Application

1. After installing all the packages, configuring the database and setting up access tokens, execute following command to run app:
   ```bash
   python3 app.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
